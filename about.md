I’m Daniel De Campos, a BE Developer / DevOps Engineer. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I worked at Buenos Aires City Government as an BE Developer, also i work as a DevOps at Accusys Technology. I enjoy eating food, taking pics, and making some music. I loves to explore and learn new technologies.

If you have any questions, happy to answer! just drop me a mail or connect with me 👇🏽.
