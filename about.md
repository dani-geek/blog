Hi 👋🏽, I’m Daniel De Campos, a computer science profesional and a freelance software engineer. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I worked at Buenos Aires City Government as an Full Stack Developer. I enjoy eating food, taking pics, and making some music. I loves to explore and learn new technologies but I often forgot things, that’s the reason why I’m doing the writing.

If you have any questions, happy to answer! just drop me a mail or connect with me 👇🏽.
